OPEN

Creates a "File Object" -> check that for methods list


open(
    file,
    mode = 'r',
    buffering = -1,
    encoding = None,
    errors = None,
    newline = None,
    closefd = True,
    opener = None
    )

    FILE
        - either a "text" or "byte string"
        - path must be included if not in the current directory
        - file descriptor? Wrapping?

    MODE (optional)
        - Specifies the mode in which the file is opened

        Options:
        - 'r' -> Open for reading in text mode
        - 'w' -> Open for writing
                    - truncating the file first means it overwrites a file that already exists
        - 'x' -> Create new file and open it for writing
        - 'a' -> Appending to a end of a file
        - 'b' -> Binary
        - 't' -> Text Mode: Specifies encoding
                    - if not specified then defaults to the platform default encoding
        - '+' -> Open a disk file for updating (read/write)

        Default Modes:
            - text: 'rt' open for reading text
                    - contents of file returned as strings

            - binary: 'w+b' opens and truncates the file to 0 bytes
                - python distinguishes b/t file of text and files of binary


    BUFFERING (optional)
        - Sets the buffer policy
        - 0 = no buffer (binary only)
        - 1 = line buffering (text mode)
        - int > 1 = fixed-size chunk buffer

    ENCODING
        - name of encoding / decoding used on files
        - if system encoding is default (leave blank)

    ERRORS
        - How to hand encoding errors
        - NOT for binary
        - default is a strict version
        - can be turned off but could lead to data loss - just leave default

    NEWLINE
        - controls how universal newlines work (text mode)
        - input:
            - 'None' : '\n', '\r', '\r\n' all == '\n'
            - ' ' : all line endings are returned untranslated

        - output:
            - 'None': all '\n' are translated to the system standard

    CLOSEFD
        - FALSE : underlying file descriptor will be kept open when the file is closed
        - Must be 'True' if file name is given

    OPENER
        -
