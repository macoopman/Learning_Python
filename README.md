  Im using this repo to store orginize my journey into python. Im taking a small detour from C to do this. I jumped into numpy, matplotlib, etc
  to add in my math learning and caught a bug. Overtime I think C and Python will go well together, from what I have seen python is built ontop
  of C and the are plenty of similar things I have noticed so far. Im did a few quick python tutorials for NumPy and Matplotlib. Now im 
  starting the Learn Python the Hard Way course. Lets see where this takes me.
